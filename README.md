# Monopoly-Aviation Edition üé≤‚úàÔ∏è \
Welcome to the Monopoly-Aviation Edition, a Python-based project that replicates the game mechanics of the classic Monopoly board game but with an exciting aviation twist! \
This project has been designed as part of a university initiative, utilizing real-world airport data as the foundation for game properties. Players will buy, sell, and trade airports with the bank, upgrade them and compete against math chances to survive within 20 rounds of the game. The game combines strategy, economic simulation, and a love for travel, making it both entertaining and educational. Whether you're an aviation enthusiast or a board game lover, this project provides a fresh take on a timeless classic. \
The game runs fully on the terminal because the front-end development has been assigned as the second phase of the project.
